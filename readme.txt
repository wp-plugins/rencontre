== Installation ==

= Install and Activate =

1. Unzip the downloaded rencontre zip file
2. Upload the `rencontre` folder and its contents into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
3. Activate Rencontre from Plugins page

= Implement =

**Primo**

Method 1 : In your theme (recommended) :

In your theme folder, in the page used for the dating part (index.php if you want to use the home page), add the content :
`&lt;?php if(is_user_logged_in()) {
$renc=new RencontreWidget; $renc->widget(0,0);} ?&gt;`

Method 2 : With a Widget :

* Create a widget area that uses the entire width of the page if it doesn't exist. See register_sidebar in 'functions.php' or in WP Support.
* Active this area in the page of your theme :
`&lt;?php if(!function_exists('dynamic_sidebar') || !dynamic_sidebar('my-area-name')) : endif; ?&gt;`
* In admin panel, move the 'rencontre' widget to 'my-area-name' area.

**Secundo**

For visitors not connected, you can view thumbnails and small profile of the last registered members using the shortcode [rencontre_libre] or php
`&lt;?php if(!is_user_logged_in()) Rencontre::f_ficheLibre(); ?&gt;`
If you write f_ficheLibre(1), there will be as many men as women.

You can also get the number of members in base with this php and ('girl'), ('men'), ('girlPhoto'), ('menPhoto') or () for all :
`&lt;?php if(!is_user_logged_in()) echo Rencontre::f_nbMembre('girlPhoto'); ?&gt;`

**Tertio**

You need to add the WP connection link. You can add this in the header to have the WP and the Facebook connections links :
`&lt;?php Rencontre::f_loginFB(); 
	wp_loginout(home_url()); if (!is_user_logged_in()) { ?&gt;
		&lt;a href="wp-login.php?action=register"&gt;&lt;?php _e('Register'); ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;?php } ?&gt;`

**Quarto**

When ready, go to admin panel and load the countries, load the profiles, set all parameters of the plugin and don't forget to save.

**Quinto**

Register as a member : Click Register, add login and email.

If you are localhost, you can't validate the email, but, in Admin panel / users, you can change the password of this new members.
Then, log in with this new login/password. Welcome to the dating part.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Useful plugins to work with Rencontre =
* WP Better Emails : Adds a customizable good looking HTML template to all WP default plain/text emails ;
* GeoIP Detect : Add IP country flag in Rencontre members admin tab - Facilitates the detection of fake profile.
* WP GeoNames : Insert all or part of the global GeoNames database in your WordPress base - Suggest city to members.

= Conditions to appear in un-logged homepage =
* Wait few days (parameter in admin) ;
* Have a photo on my profile ;
* Have an attention-catcher and an ad with more than 30 characters ;
* Rencontre::f_ficheLibre() is on the right template.

= How to personalize style =
The default style file is located in `rencontre/css/rencontre.css`.
You simply need to copy lines to be modified in the css file of your theme. And you can as well add other lines.
To overwrite default css file, add `#widgRenc` (and space) at the beginning of every new line.
Example :
`in rencontre.css :
.rencTab {background-color:#e8e5ce;}
in your css file :
#widgRenc .rencTab {background-color:#aaa; padding:1px;}`

= How to show only the girls in un-logged homepage =
There are four categories differentiated by a different class CSS : girl, men, gaygirl and gaymen.
To see only the heterosexual girls, add in the CSS file of your theme
`#widgRenc .rencBox.men,
#widgRenc .rencBox.gaygirl,
#widgRenc .rencBox.gaymen{display:none;}`

= How to set the plugin multilingual =
Add little flags in the header of your theme. On click, you create cookie with the right language. Then, the site changes language (back and front office) :
`&lt;div id="lang"&gt;
	&lt;a href="" title="Fran&ccedil;ais" onClick="javascript:document.cookie='lang=fr_FR'"&gt;
		&lt;img src="&lt;?php echo plugins_url('rencontre/images/drapeaux/France.png'); ?&gt;" alt="Fran&ccedil;ais" /&gt;
	&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href="" title="English" onClick="javascript:document.cookie='lang=en_US'"&gt;
		&lt;img src="&lt;?php echo plugins_url('rencontre/images/drapeaux/Royaume-Uni.png'); ?&gt;" alt="English" /&gt;
	&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;`

= What to include with WP-GeoNames =
* Columns : minimum is name, latitude, longitude, country code, feature class & code.
* Type of data : only P (city).

It's better to limit the data size.
