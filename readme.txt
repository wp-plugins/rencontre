== Installation ==

*Install and Activate*

1. Unzip the downloaded rencontre zip file
2. Upload the `rencontre` folder and its contents into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
3. Activate Rencontre from Plugins page

*Implement*

Method 1 : In your theme :

In your theme folder, in the page used for the dating part (index.php if you want to use the home page), add the content :
`&lt;?php if(is_user_logged_in()) {
$renc=new RencontreWidget; $renc->widget(0,0);} ?&gt;`

Method 2 : With a Widget :

* Create a widget area that uses the entire width of the page if it doesn't exist. See register_sidebar in 'functions.php' or in WP Support.
* Active this area in the page of your theme :
`&lt;?php if(!function_exists('dynamic_sidebar') || !dynamic_sidebar('my-area-name')) : endif; ?&gt;`
* In admin panel, move the 'rencontre' widget to 'my-area-name' area.

For visitors not connected, you can view thumbnails and small profile of the last registered members using the shortcode [rencontre_libre] or php
`&lt;?php if(!is_user_logged_in()) Rencontre::f_ficheLibre(); ?&gt;`

You need to add the WP connection link. You can add this in the header to have the WP and the Facebook connections links :
`&lt;?php Rencontre::f_loginFB(); 
	wp_loginout(home_url()); if (!is_user_logged_in()) { ?&gt;
		&lt;a href="wp-login.php?action=register"&gt;&lt;?php _e('Register'); ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;?php } ?&gt;`

When ready, go to admin panel and load the countries, load the profiles, set all parameters of the plugin and don't forget to save.
